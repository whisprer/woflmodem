## Security

Security is a **top priority** for this project.

- **Never commit secrets** (keys, passwords, tokens) to the repository.
- Security-sensitive changes require extra scrutiny - please open an issue first.
- Report vulnerabilities privately via email (see SECURITY.md).
- All cryptographic code must:
- Use established libraries (`ring`, `rustcrypto`, etc.)
- Undergo peer review before merging
- Include comprehensive test coverage
- Be fuzz-tested where applicable

## Areas of Contribution

### High Priority
- Security hardening (cryptographic primitives, secure key management)
- Signal processing optimization (echo cancellation, equalization)
- Test coverage expansion
- Performance profiling and optimization

### Medium Priority
- Extended protocol support (V.32, V.34, etc.)
- Cross-platform audio improvements
- Documentation and examples
- Fuzzing infrastructure

### Low Priority
- GUI/CLI improvements
- Additional platform support
- Protocol analysis tools

## Communication

- **Issues**: Bug reports, feature requests, questions
- **Discussions**: Design discussions, architecture proposals
- **Pull Requests**: Code contributions with clear descriptions

When opening an issue, please include:
- Clear description of the problem or feature
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Platform/OS details
- Rust version (`rustc --version`)
- Relevant logs or error messages

## Code Review

All contributions go through code review:
- Maintainers will review for correctness, style, and performance.
- CI must pass (builds, tests, lints).
- Security-sensitive changes require additional review.
- Be responsive to feedback and iterate as needed.

Thanks for helping build the future of software modems with woflmodem! 🐺
All set, fren! These docs are now fully tailored to your woflmodem project with v0.0.1 status, your ambitious security-first + stability roadmap, and all the Rust/HSF/V.22 goodness wired right in. Ready to paste straight into your repo! 🐺📡## Security
